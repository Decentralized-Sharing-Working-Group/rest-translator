# fetch-and-deliver proxy for server-to-server sharing

Put this proxy in front of a server with any of the following APIs:
  * Cozy Files app
  * remoteStorage
  * WebDAV
  * Swell-REST
  * CouchDB

You can then share to this proxy OC7-style. It will fetch-and-deliver once.
A demo is [in the Dockerfile](https://github.com/Decentralized-Sharing-Working-Group/server-to-server/blob/master/Dockerfile#L4).
